### Release 4.1.0:

- Added serviceKind parameter to marketplace API endpoints for filtering apps/bundles by category

- Implemented tab-based UI in Marketplace with separate views for staged/published Apps/Bundles

- Scoped Publish and Delete All buttons per tab to prevent accidental cross-category operations

- Updated backend functions to filter apps/bundles based on serviceKind

- Modified API routes to accept and pass serviceKind query parameter

- Maintained full backward compatibility - existing clients continue to work without changes

- Improved safety and user control with explicit UI-driven categorization instead of auto-detection
